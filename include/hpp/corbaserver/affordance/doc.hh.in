/// \section hpp_affordance_corba_intro Introduction
///
/// This package implements a Corba server running the hpp-affordance
/// package functions and the corresponding client.
///
/// The corba server part is compiled into library
/// \c libhpp-affordance-corba.so that implements the following
/// class:
///   \li hpp::affordanceCorba::Server.
/// The corba services provided by the library are described in interface
///   \li hpp::corbaserver::affordance::Afford.
///
/// The client part is provided through python module
/// \c hpp.corbaserver.affordance
///
/// An executable called \c hpp-affordance-server is installed.
/// This executable runs
///   \li the corba server implemented by library
///       \c libhpp-affordance-corba.so, as well as
///   \li the corba server implemented in \htmlonly<a class="el" href="@HPP_CORBASERVER_DOXYGENDOCDIR@/index.html">hpp-corbaserver</a>\endhtmlonly.
///
/// See these package documentations for details.
///
/// \section hpp_affordance_corba_howto_communicate \
/// How to communicate with the CORBA server
///
/// The easiest way is to launch the \c hpp-affordance-server executable,
/// open a python terminal and type:
///
///     \code
///     from hpp.corbaserver.affordance import Client as AffordanceClient
///     aff = AffordanceClient ()
///     \endcode
/// Then variable aff contains a member \c affordance that can send
/// requests to the server. For instance
///
///     \code
///     aff.affordance.analyseAll ()
///     \endcode
///
/// A python class is provided that embeds a corba client and
/// that forwards corba resquest to the server side:
///   \li affordance.affordance.AffordanceTool to create and manipulate affordance objects.
///
/// \section hpp_affordance_corba_how_to_embed \
/// How to embed a server in an application
///
/// Embedding the corba server into an application can be done by linking the
/// application with \c libhpp-affordance-corba.so in a similar way as
/// hpp-corbaserver corba server.
